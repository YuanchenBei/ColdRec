# ❄️ ColdRec 🔥
☃️ **ColdRec** is a comprehensive open-source toolkit and benchmark for cold-start recommendation. In coldrec, models follow a ***unified pipeline***, the datasets follow a ***unified division***, and tasks include ***cold user/item recommendation***, ***warm user/item recommendation***, and ***overall user/item recommendation***, targeting at providing the community with a ***comprehensive*** and ***fair*** benchmark evaluation for cold-start recommendation.

  - [🛫 Requirements](#-requirements)
  - [🚀 Quick Start](#-quick-start)
  - [🧸 Supported Models](#-supported-models)

🥳 **Update in 2024.06.30**: Add automatic hyper-parameter tuning, you can install one more base library *optuna* to include this module.

---
## 🛫 Requirements
ColdRec hopes to avoid the complicated and tedious packaging process and uses native ***pytorch*** and a small number of necessary libraries to build the codebase.

``` bash
python >= 3.8.0 
torch >= 1.11.0
faiss-gpu >= 1.7.3
pandas >= 2.0.3
numba >= 0.58.1 
numpy >= 1.24.4
scikit-learn >= 1.3.2
pickle >= 0.7.5
optuna >= 3.6.1 (If you need automatic hyper-parameter tuning) 
```

---
## 🚀 Quick Start
**1️⃣ Dataset Preprocess**

We have provided the preprocessed datasets in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13JJ25vf5dpFzxe1ITQYONrEIUAsB2ZU8?usp=sharing). You can download the dataset from the Google Drive link directly, unzip it, and place it into the ***./data*** folder. Then, you can process it into the format for model training with ***simple two scripts***, of which the details can be found in the page of [dataset details](https://github.com/YuanchenBei/ColdRec/blob/main/data/README.md).

**2️⃣ Warm Embedding Pre-Training**

This step is *not necessary*, but since most of the work requires this step, it is *recommended* to complete this step to fully evaluate all models. We have provided both widely adopted collaborative filtering modle MF and graph-based model LightGCN as warm recommender. You can obtain the pre-trained warm user/item embeddings with the following two options:

***Options 1:*** You can directly access the BPR-MF pre-trained embeddings at the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cHTWgNGTlWJwO2ziS4crxkpuH38rTeCf?usp=sharing). Then, the embedding folder associated to each dataset should be placed in the ***./emb*** folder.

***Options 2:*** You can also pre-train the warm embedding by yourself. Specifically, you can simply obtain the pre-trained warm embeddings by running the following script:
``` bash
python main.py --dataset [DATASET NAME] --model [WARM RECOMMENDER] --cold_object [user/item]
```
In the above script, the **[DATASET NAME]** for --dataset should be replaced by your target dataset name, such as movielens. Then, the **[WARM RECOMMENDER]** for --model should be selected as the warm recommender type (MF, LightGCN, NCL, SimGCL, and XSimGCL). Finally, the **[user/item]** for --cold_object should be selected as user or item for the user cold-start setting or item cold-start setting.

**3️⃣ Cold-Start Model Training and Evaluation**

Coming to this step, you can start to train the cold-start model with one script:
``` bash
python main.py --dataset [DATASET NAME] --model [MODEL NAME] --cold_object [user/item]
```
In the above script, the **[MODEL NAME]** for --model is the expected model name, where we have provided 20 representative models as the **Supported Models**. You can also flexibly register your own model with the ColdRec framework for evaluation.

**4️⃣ (Option) Automatic Hyper-parameter Tuning**

ColdRec also supports automatic hyper-parameter tuning. You can tune hyper-parameters with optuna with one script:
``` bash
python param_search.py --dataset [DATASET NAME] --model [MODEL NAME] --cold_object [user/item]
```
You can flexibly set the tuning range in param_search.py.
