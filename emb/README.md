## ðŸ¤– Embeddings
This folder is utilized to store the trained embeddings. Due to lots of cold-start models adopt the pre-trained warm embeddings for training, it is better to pre-train the embeddings for warm recommender models (MF/LightGCN).

The link to access the MF-pretrained warm user/item embeddings is available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cHTWgNGTlWJwO2ziS4crxkpuH38rTeCf?usp=sharing.
